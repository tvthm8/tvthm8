# Hi, I'm Tevin Thomas! üëã
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently working toward my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering Technology at Excelsior University while finishing up my Associate's in Computer Engineering at Savannah Technical College. As an aspiring engineer, I'm passionate about integrating technology to solve real-world problems, with particular interest in artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and software engineering.

## A Little About Me üöÄ
I'm originally from a small town called Statesboro, Georgia. Growing up in a tight-knit community has shaped me into someone who enjoys collaborating and working on projects that bring people together through innovation. My educational journey has been focused on exploring both the hardware and software aspects of technology, and I am constantly looking for ways to bridge the gap between the two.

As an engineer-in-training, I strive to stay curious and learn new things every day, whether it‚Äôs through coursework, side projects, or collaborating with others. I am excited about the future of AI and automation, and how these technologies can be used to create smarter systems, improve efficiency, and positively impact our daily lives.
